"""Python
There is no negative marking in our class
"""
"""
Why Python:
1. Easy Programming Language at Basic Level:
User Friendly Lang
2. Open Source.
3. Interpreter based language
4. Platform Independent Language
5. Modular Approach of Programming 
6. Python support OOPS
7. Very Flexible Language
8. Big set of standard libraries: 
2.35 Lakhs+ Libraries: Each library is having
100 to 50k set of functions, methods or classes.
9. Used in Versatile Domains.
10. Dynamic Data Type Definition 
11. Dynamic Memory Allocation.
Many more reasons to go.


Drawbacks of Python:
1. Very Slow Language
2. To much memory consumption

# print("hitesh")
# print("hello")
# pr("abc")
# print("Welcome")
# print("1234")

"""
Platform Independent Language:

Portability: WORA: If you write your code on one
OS and if the same code without any change can 
be executed on any other OS then we say our
language/technology/code is portable.

Platform Independent: CORA: Compile Once Run
Anywhere. If you write your code on one
OS, and compile the code, after compilation, if
 the compiled code can be executed on any 
 other OS then we say our language/technology/
 code is platform independent.
